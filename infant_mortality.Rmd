#### A report prepared to describe infant mortality in Warren County in 2016

##### 

# Introduction

The Maternal and Infant Health Report - 2016 is part of an initiative to improve
access to prenatal care, decrease infant mortality, and improve maternal and
child health in Warren County. The risks to the health of mothers and their
infants need to be identified and assessed in order to find solutions to improve
and protect their short-term and long-term health.

The data in this report is developed using data collected from the birth and
death records of residents in Warren County in 2016. The data is deidentified
and compiled to identify trends of concern and to identify areas of the data
that require additional exploration and analysis.

## Methods

This report is generated using a series of datasets from various public and
non-public datasets. These data have been accessed in the most raw version of
data that is available or the data was retrieved from a web API. This ensures
that analyses that are conducted are being done on the original data and are not
calculations based on the calculations of others.

All of the code for the generation of these reports is devleoped using the R
Statistical Programming Language [@R-Project] and the R Studio IDE [@R-Studio].
The code used for the devleopment of this report is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/DustinRatliff/AnnualUpdate). A copy of this report
will be maintained on the Warren County Health District
[website](http://warrenchd.com/document-category/assessments).

### Data Analysis

The data that has been compiled is analyzed using multiple methodologies. Data
is first assessed to identify what information can be found in the raw
information. The data then goes through the following process [@Wickham2017] :

`r include_graphics("template/graphics/data-science-explore.png")`

Data is summarily analyzed at the inter-county and intra-county level to
identify differences. These type of analysis allow an exploration of the county
for sub-county data and identify areas that are more likely to have health
disparities.

### Data Sets

The following data sets have been used to develop this analysis:

  * 2016 Death Data File [@ODHDeath2016]
  * 2016 Restricted Access Ohio Resident Live Births [@ODHBirth2016]

#####

# Infant Mortality

Infant mortality is the death of an infant before their first birthday.
[@CDC_InfMort] Infant mortality is an indicator of inequality in an area.

$$ {Infant\;Mortality\;Rate} =
\frac{{Number\;of\;Resident\;Infant\;Deaths\;<\;1\;Year\;Old}}
{{Number\;of\;Resident\;Live\;Births}}\;{\times\;1,000}$$

###### IMR in 2016: 5.3

###### IMR in 2015: 4.2

#### There has been a 26% INCREASE in IMR over the last year

# Preterm Birth

Preterm birth is a significant risk factor for infant mortality and many other 
negative health outcomes. 

Preterm Births are infants born before 37 weeks gestation. Very-Preterm Births 
are infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. Less than 23 Weeks births are 
infants born before 23 week of gestation.

###### 250 preterm babies were born 2016

`r include_graphics("charts/preterm_comb.png")`

#### There was a 8.7% increase in the number of preterm births between 2015 and 2016

#####

# Low Birth Weight

Babies with a birthweight of less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces (2,500 grams) are
considered to have a low birth weight. Low birth weight is primarily caused by
premature birth. Babies with a low birth weight can face multiple challenges
including having trouble keeping their bodies at the right temperature, having
trouble breathing, nad difficulty feeding and gaining weight.

###### 171 babies had a low birthweight in 2016

```{r birth weight, include=FALSE}
low_birth <- birth %>%

#### 7.0% of babies born in 2016 had a low birthweight compared to 7.2% in 2015
#### There was a 2.8% decrease in the percentage of babies that had a low birth weight between 2015 and 2016

# Maternal Smoking

Tobacco use can be harmful to a developing baby and the mother. Maternal smoking
is the percent of mothers who smoked during the second or third trimester.

###### Only 6.7% of Pregnant Women Smoked in 2016

```{r smoking, include = FALSE}

# Prenatal Care

A healthy birth is supported by a health pregnancy. Prenatal care improves the 
chances of a healthy pregnancy. Early prenatal care access is the percentage of 
mothers that receive prenatal care in the first trimester of their pregnancy.

###### 75.8% of pregnant women received care in 2016
